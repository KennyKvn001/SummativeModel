# Dropout Predictor Model

## Problem statement

Student dropout is a significant issue in Rwandaâ€™s higher education sector, influenced by financial, academic, and personal challenges. Existing research underscores the need for context-specific, predictive approaches to address dropout risks in Rwanda. For instance, a study on school dropout and students' academic performance in Rwanda highlights the impact of dropout rates on educational productivity. This Model aims to bridge the gap by incorporating Rwanda-specific data and providing a solution for educators and policymakers.
